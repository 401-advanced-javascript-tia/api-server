Monday : 8-17-20 : **Phase 1** 
- API should perform CRUD operations using ReST methods on 2 data models (categories and products) using json-server, can test in terminal using HTTPIE
- Set goal for business requirements
- Created working documentation with Swagger Hub

Tuesday : 8-18-20 : **Phase 2** 
- Transition from json-server that served as a "mock" towards an API server using Express and Node.js
  - Create full express server with modular middleware and routes
  - Note that today data doesn't persist between server sessions, that functonality will come in future phase
